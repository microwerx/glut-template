This is boilerplate OpenGL Utility Toolkit code. Why reinvent the wheel everytime you just want to get some C++ OpenGL going?

## Goals

* Quick boiler plate for running modern OpenGL or classic OpenGL code
* Enough boiler plate code to get shaders going

## Implemented Features

* GLEW
* Enhanced built in font functions
* Keyboard and Mouse support

## Planned Features

* Vector2, Vector3 and Vector4 classes
* Matrix4 class
* Matrix4Stack class
* SimpleGeometryMesh class
* Render Configurations
* Shader Programs
* Load/Save PPM files
* Load/Save SCN/OBJ/MTL files (Alias/Wavefront derivative)
* Some more glutSolid... and glutWire... drawing functions
